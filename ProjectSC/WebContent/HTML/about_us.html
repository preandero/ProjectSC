                 <p>Asangbinsi’s mission is to make commerce better for everyone. But Shopify can’t be all things to all people. Instead, we empower third-party developers, known as Shopify Partners, to create apps, themes, and other integrations that build on Shopify’s platform. That way, merchants can tailor their experience however they need, and developers can build their own businesses supporting those entrepreneurs. This virtuous circle creates new business opportunities and benefits merchants, partners, and Shopify.</p>
